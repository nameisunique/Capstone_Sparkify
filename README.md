# Sparkify

This is my Capstone project for my Udacity Data Scientist course.

The Blog Post on Sparkify can be found here: https://nameisunique.github.io/

This project digs deep into Big Data, Pyspark, Python combined with SQL, along with examining user data from Sparkify. Sparkify is Udacity's (on paper) online music portal, letting both free and paid users play music, create playlists, invite friends, and overall have a great online music experience.

The goal of this project centers around one main question: Who will churn? Sparkify wants to keep both it's paid and free customers, and those that leave are considered to have "churned". Machine Language models come to the rescue to help identify users most likely to churn.

This project will use data provided by Udacity as the basis for the examination per the rubric.
